README explaining two particular things about the pom.xml here:


1) It uses M2E Lifecylce Mapping, to (try to) tell m2e NOT to run any plugins inside Eclipse,
as one typically really only wants the Maven Dependencies Classpath Container:

	@see https://docs.sonatype.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2949459 
	Simulating "java-only" lifecycle mapping with m2e 0.9.9.200909092308 Also 
	https://docs.sonatype.org/display/M2ECLIPSE/Customizable+build+lifecycle+mapping+for+m2e+extensions+developers 
	Also https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/MNGECLIPSE-2209 Also https://docs.sonatype.org/display/M2ECLIPSE/Maven+build+lifecycle 
	Also http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/maven-3/trunk/pom.xml as an example 
	Also https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/MNGECLIPSE-2252 -->

This, combined with using Eclipse Class Folders (see Project Properties > Java
Build Path > Libraries), leads to better build performance, and less problems.

One theoretical drawback is that e.g. Resource Filter is then not available within Eclipse, but a) that
(constrasted with the build speed gain) is rarely really an issue, and b) doesn't seem to really
work as intended (by m2e) anyway (m2e version at the time of writing).


2) It has some magic which keeps the build output folder separate for  Eclipse and the Maven.
This is required because the CLI Maven build puts files into the target which when running
inside Eclipse we already have on the classpath via Class Folders (see Project Properties > 
Java Build Path > Libraries).

Re. "many Maven plugins have assumptions about location of compiled classes and resources
and in many cases, changing output folders would simply break those Maven plugins", this should
not be an issue, because of the lifecycle-mapping explaining above.

By default, build dir is CLI Maven's 'target' directory.  A m2e-activated maven profiled
override that with 'target-eclipse'.  That directory HAS TO MATCH what is in an Eclipse project's .classpath.
